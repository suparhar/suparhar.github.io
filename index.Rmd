You can do everything you usually do 

That means you can add text 

this website is an exmaple coming from [p8105](https://p8105.com/index.html). Making websites today

I also use [Google](https://www.google.com/) a lot

This wesbite was coded by sukh using RMarkdown to do all the hardwork. Learn more about this site [Here](about.html).

To show that you can just use R like normal, check out this page with some [Plots](plots.html).
