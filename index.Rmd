<h3>MPH in Epidemiology | Quantitative Researcher | Data & Health Science Enthusiast</h3>

Iâ€™m a Master of Public Health student in Epidemiology at Columbia University, where I focus on quantitative methods and the intersection of data, health, and equity. My background spans epidemiologic research, statistical modeling, and systems-level analyses of structural determinants of health.

Currently, Iâ€™m a Quantitative Foundations Teaching Assistant at Columbia and a research assistant in the Llanos Lab, where Iâ€™m leading systematic reviews on structural racism and cervical cancer outcomes. I also work on large-scale epidemiologic analyses using datasets such as NHANES and NYC health surveys.

Iâ€™m passionate about applying rigorous quantitative tools to improve decision-making in healthcare, policy, and industry. My long-term interests lie at the intersection of data science, epidemiology, and impact â€” whether thatâ€™s in public health research, consulting, or biotech analytics.
