## ðŸ’¡ NHANES Analysis: Income and Obesity in U.S. Adults  
**Columbia University, P8105 Final Project | 2025**

- Analyzed **NHANES 2017â€“2018** data to evaluate the association between **household income** and **obesity prevalence** among adults.  
- Applied **multivariable logistic regression** controlling for gender, age, and physical activity using **SAS** and **R**.  
- Tested **gender as an effect modifier** and visualized stratified estimates using `ggplot2`.  
- Produced publication-quality figures and tables aligned with CDC obesity metrics.
