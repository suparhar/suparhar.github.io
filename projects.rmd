# Projects & Research Highlights

Welcome to my project portfolio ‚Äî a collection of academic, quantitative, and data-driven work that reflects my interests at the intersection of **epidemiology, data science, and health equity**.  
Each project emphasizes rigorous analytic methods, clear visualization, and reproducible workflows.

## Structural Racism and Cervical Cancer Outcomes  
**Llanos Lab, Columbia University | 2025 ‚Äì Present**

- Conducting a large-scale **systematic review** examining structural racism and disparities in cervical cancer incidence, survival, and screening.  
- Leading data extraction in Covidence across >20 peer-reviewed studies.  
- Mapping exposure‚Äìoutcome pathways involving healthcare access, socioeconomic status, and neighborhood-level structural inequities.  
- Synthesizing results for manuscript submission and national presentation.  
- Collaborating on NIH-funded work integrating epidemiologic frameworks and equity metrics.

## Stanford Medicine ‚Äî Center for Asian Health Research and Education (CARE)  
**Research Scholar | 2023 ‚Äì 2024**

At Stanford CARE, I worked on two quantitative projects focused on health disparities in **disaggregated Asian-American** populations.

### Sleep and Mental Health Disparities in Asian-American Subgroups
- Led statistical analyses using **NHIS** to examine relationships between **sleep duration**, **depressive symptoms**, and **mortality risk** across Asian-American subgroups.  
- Built and visualized **multivariable regression models** to highlight **intra-Asian heterogeneity** in sleep and mental health patterns.  
- Presented results at the **Stanford CARE Summer Symposium** and contributed to manuscripts and curriculum materials for **Stanford Medicine‚Äôs Asian Health** program.

### Differential Glioma Mortality and Grading in Asian-American Subgroups  
**Published abstract in *Neurology* (2024): [Read here](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000206661)**  
- Conducted subgroup analyses using **SEER** to assess **glioma (brain tumor) grading** and **mortality** among East, South, and Southeast Asian populations.  
- Identified significant differences in **tumor grade distribution** and **mortality rates** across subgroups, underscoring the need for **data disaggregation** in neuro-oncology.  
- Contributed to modeling and interpretation included in the published abstract.
