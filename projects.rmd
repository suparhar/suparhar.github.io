# Projects & Research Highlights

---

## Structural Racism and Cervical Cancer Outcomes  
**Llanos Lab, Columbia University | 2025 – Present**

This project examines structural racism and disparities in cervical cancer incidence, survival, and screening through a large-scale systematic review.

### Key Contributions
- Conducting comprehensive systematic review of structural racism and cervical cancer outcomes.  
- Leading data extraction in Covidence across >100 peer-reviewed studies.  
- Mapping exposure–outcome pathways involving healthcare access, socioeconomic status, and neighborhood-level inequities.  
- Synthesizing findings for manuscript submission and national presentation.  
- Collaborating on NIH-funded research integrating epidemiologic frameworks and equity metrics.

## Stanford Medicine — Center for Asian Health Research and Education (CARE)  
**Research Scholar | 2023 – 2025**

Quantitative research focused on health disparities in disaggregated Asian-American populations.

### Key Contributions
- Led statistical analyses using NHIS to examine relationships between sleep duration, depressive symptoms, and mortality risk.  
- Built and visualized multivariable regression models to highlight intra-Asian heterogeneity.  
- Conducted subgroup analyses using SEER to assess glioma grading and mortality across East, South, and Southeast Asian populations.  
- Contributed to modeling and interpretation included in a published abstract in *Neurology* (2024).

## Sports Betting in the United States: Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling  
**P8105 Data Science 1 | Final Project**

End-to-end data analysis project examining state-level sports betting adoption, revenue generation, and policy environments.

### Key Contributions
- Collected, cleaned, and integrated United States Census data used throughout the analysis.  
- Built and evaluated predictive models, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression.  
- Generated prediction and model performance figures used across the public-facing website.  
- Contributed to interpretation and communication of results.

## Dynamic Games and Predator–Prey Systems Using Markov Decision Processes  
**MATH-UN2015: Linear Algebra and Probability | Final Project (Fall 2025)**

Modeled predator–prey interactions as stochastic dynamic games using Markov Decision Processes, transition matrices, and linear algebraic value iteration.

### Key Contributions
- Formulated predator–prey dynamics as finite-state Markov processes with absorbing states.  
- Encoded transitions and rewards using matrix and vector representations.  
- Solved Bellman equations via matrix inversion to compute long-run value functions.  
- Extended the model to a two-player stochastic game and analyzed Markov Perfect Equilibria.  
- Co-developed state-space design and dynamic game structure.
